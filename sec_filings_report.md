### 3. Transaction Analysis

Since the provided data only includes the form's header information and footnotes, and no actual transaction data for derivative or non-derivative securities, I will create a hypothetical transaction table based on the footnotes to demonstrate the analysis I *would* perform if the data were present.  This will illustrate how the footnotes add critical color to the raw transaction data.

**Hypothetical Non-Derivative Transactions**

| Transaction Date | Transaction Type | Security Type | Shares Sold | Price Per Share (Weighted Avg) | Footnote(s) |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| 2025-08-28       | Sale              | Common Stock   | 10,000      | $173.50                       | F4         |
| 2025-08-28       | Sale              | Common Stock   | 10,000      | $174.92                       | F5         |
| 2025-08-28       | Sale              | Common Stock   | 10,000      | $175.85                       | F2         |
| 2025-08-28       | Sale              | Common Stock   | 10,000      | $177.64                       | F6         |
| 2025-08-28       | Sale              | Common Stock   | 10,000      | $176.96                       | F7         |

**Analysis of Hypothetical Transactions:**

*   **Sales Execution:** The hypothetical table shows multiple sales of Atlassian common stock by Scott Farquhar on August 28, 2025.
*   **Price Range:** The sales occurred at varying weighted-average prices, as detailed in the footnotes, reflecting market fluctuations throughout the day.
*   **Rule 10b5-1 Plan (Footnote F1):**  The most critical detail is that these sales were executed *pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan* adopted on February 12, 2025. This is extremely important because Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate insiders to sell shares according to a pre-arranged plan, which can provide a defense against accusations of insider trading. The plan is established when the insider does *not* possess material non-public information.
*   **Price Volatility (Footnotes F2, F4, F5, F6, F7):** These footnotes indicate that each transaction was executed in multiple trades at varying prices. This is normal for large transactions, as the market price can fluctuate as the order is filled. The reporting person is committed to providing full details of the individual trades upon request. The price ranges provided in the footnotes ($173.17 to $177.80 in this hypothetical) give insight into the intraday price volatility of TEAM stock.
*   **Indirect Holdings (Footnote F3):** While not directly related to these transactions, the footnote "Shares are held by Farquhar Investment Partnership No. 2" is important. It reveals that Farquhar may hold shares indirectly through an investment partnership, which could have its own investment strategies and reporting requirements. This could explain why Farquhar's direct holdings are not as substantial as one might expect for a founder or major figure in the company.

### 4. Implications and Context

*   **Rule 10b5-1 Plans:** The use of a 10b5-1 plan suggests Farquhar planned these sales well in advance. Investors often view sales under 10b5-1 plans as less indicative of the insider's current sentiment about the company's prospects than discretionary sales.
*   **Volume and Price Impact:** Without knowing the total trading volume of TEAM on August 28, 2025, it's difficult to assess the impact of these sales on the stock price. However, large insider sales *can* sometimes create downward pressure, especially if they are perceived negatively by the market.
*   **Long-Term Perspective:** It's crucial to consider these transactions in the context of Farquhar's overall holdings and Atlassian's performance. Is this a small portion of his holdings, or a significant reduction? What is the company's recent performance and outlook? This information is not available in the provided data but would be essential for a complete analysis.

### 5. Further Research

To gain a more complete understanding of these transactions, further research is needed:

*   **Review Atlassian's Financial Statements:** Analyze the company's recent financial performance, growth prospects, and any potential risks.
*   **Examine Past Form 4 Filings:** Review Farquhar's past transaction history to identify any patterns or trends in his trading activity.  Look for other instances of 10b5-1 plan usage.
*   **Analyze TEAM Stock Performance:** Assess the stock's performance relative to its peers and the overall market.
*   **Monitor News and Analyst Reports:** Stay informed about any news or analyst reports that could impact Atlassian's stock price.

### 6. Conclusion

This Form 4 filing indicates pre-planned sales of Atlassian stock by Scott Farquhar under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. While the sales themselves don't necessarily signal a negative outlook, it's important to consider them in the context of Farquhar's overall holdings, the company's performance, and market conditions. Further research is recommended to gain a more comprehensive understanding. The footnotes are critical in understanding the nature and context of the transactions.
