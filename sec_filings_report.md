# SEC Filings Summary

**Overall Summary:**

This report analyzes a Form 4 filing by Scott Farquhar, concerning transactions in Atlassian Corp (TEAM) shares. The key finding is that Farquhar executed multiple sales of Atlassian shares on August 28, 2025, under a pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted on February 12, 2025. The transactions were executed at weighted-average prices, with the shares held through Farquhar Investment Partnership No. 2. The existence of the 10b5-1 plan suggests that the sales were pre-planned and not based on any recent non-public information. However, a comprehensive assessment requires further analysis of Farquhar's past trading activity, the timing of the plan's adoption relative to any potential material events at Atlassian, and overall insider trading trends at Atlassian. The weighted-average pricing indicates the transactions occurred over time, likely through a broker.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Weighted-Average Pricing:** Transactions occurred over a period at varying prices, indicating execution through a broker.
*   **Investment Partnership:** Shares are held through an investment partnership, potentially impacting tax and estate planning.

*   Each row represents a different sale, with varying numbers of shares sold at different weighted-average prices.
*   The footnotes associated with each transaction (F1, F2, F4, F5, F6, F7) provide important context.

### 4. Footnote Analysis

The footnotes provide critical details about the nature of the transactions.

*   **F1:** "This transaction was effected pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by the Reporting Person on February 12, 2025."

    *   This footnote indicates that the sales were executed according to a pre-arranged trading plan under Rule 10b5-1. Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate insiders to sell shares without being accused of trading on non-public information, provided the trading plan was established before the insider possessed such information. This suggests that the sales were planned well in advance.

*   **F2:** "This transaction was executed in multiple trades during the day at prices ranging from $175.42 to $176.38. The weighted-average price is reported above. The Reporting Person hereby undertakes to provide upon request to the SEC staff, the issuer or a security holder of the issuer full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected."

    *   This footnote explains that the reported price is a weighted average due to multiple trades occurring at slightly different prices throughout the day. It also confirms the reporting person's willingness to provide detailed trade-by-trade information upon request.

*   **F3:** "Shares are held by Farquhar Investment Partnership No. 2."

    *   This footnote indicates that the shares are held through an investment partnership. This is relevant for understanding the ownership structure and potential tax implications of the transactions.

*   **F4:** "This transaction was executed in multiple trades during the day at prices ranging from $173.17 to $173.92. The weighted-average price is reported above. The Reporting Person hereby undertakes to provide upon request to the SEC staff, the issuer or a security holder of the issuer full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected."

    *   Similar to F2, this explains the weighted-average price for another transaction.

*   **F5:** "This transaction was executed in multiple trades during the day at prices ranging from $174.42 to $175.42. The weighted-average price is reported above. The Reporting Person hereby undertakes to provide upon request to the SEC staff, the issuer or a security holder of the issuer full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected."

    *   Similar to F2 and F4, this explains the weighted-average price for another transaction.

*   **F6:** "This transaction was executed in multiple trades during the day at prices ranging from $177.47 to $177.80. The weighted-average price is reported above. The Reporting Person hereby undertakes to provide upon request to the SEC staff, the issuer or a security holder of the issuer full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected."

    *   Similar to F2, F4 and F5, this explains the weighted-average price for another transaction.

*   **F7:** "This transaction was executed in multiple trades during the day at prices ranging from $176.47 to $177.45. The weighted-average price is reported above. The Reporting Person hereby undertakes to provide upon request to the SEC staff, the issuer or a security holder of the issuer full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected."

    *   Similar to F2, F4, F5 and F6, this explains the weighted-average price for another transaction.

### 5. Implications and Considerations

*   **Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan:** The existence of a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan is a significant factor. It suggests that these sales were pre-planned and not based on any recent non-public information. However, it's important to consider the timing of the plan's adoption (February 12, 2025) relative to any potential material events at Atlassian.
*   **Weighted-Average Pricing:** The use of weighted-average pricing indicates that the transactions were executed over a period of time, likely through a broker.
*   **Investment Partnership:** The fact that the shares are held by an investment partnership may have tax and estate planning implications for Scott Farquhar.
*   **Overall Trend:** To gain a comprehensive understanding, this filing should be analyzed in conjunction with Farquhar's past trading activity and overall insider trading trends at Atlassian. Observing a pattern of consistent selling under a 10b5-1 plan would be less concerning than sporadic, large sales.

### 6. Conclusion

This Form 4 filing reveals that Scott Farquhar executed sales of Atlassian shares under a pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. The footnotes provide valuable context, indicating that the transactions occurred at weighted-average prices and that the shares are held through an investment partnership. While the existence of a 10b5-1 plan mitigates concerns about insider trading, further analysis of past trading activity and the timing of the plan's adoption is warranted for a complete assessment.
