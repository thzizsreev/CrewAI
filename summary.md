| -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Security                   | OPTION TO BUY: RT-TO-BUY |

| Ownership Type             | D                      |

**Analysis:**

*   **Security Type:** The security involved is an option to buy TRUSTCO BANK CORP N Y stock, specifically a "RT-TO-BUY" option.  The "RT" likely refers to a Retirement-related grant.
*   **Transaction Date:** On August 27, 2025, Michael James Hall executed a transaction.
*   **Shares Involved:** 225 shares were involved in this transaction.
*   **Price:** The exercise price of the option was $0. This suggests these were granted options as part of a compensation package.
*   **Transaction Code (M):** The transaction code "M" indicates the exercise of a derivative security. In this case, Hall exercised his option to purchase shares.
*   **Acquired/Disposed (D):** The "D" signifies that the shares obtained through the option exercise were then disposed of. This suggests a "cashless exercise" where the shares acquired upon exercise are immediately sold to cover the exercise cost (which is $0 here) and any associated taxes.
*   **Expiration Date:** The options had an expiration date of November 17, 2025.
*   **Post-Transaction Holdings:** After the transaction, Hall held 0 shares of this derivative. This confirms that the exercised options were fully disposed of.
*   **Ownership Type (D):** This indicates direct ownership before the disposal.

### 3. Footnote Analysis

The filing includes a footnote (F1) that provides crucial context regarding the vesting schedule of the options.

**Footnote F1:** "Award vested in equal installments from the first thought the fifth year following the award date, and was fully vested on November 17, 2020."

**Interpretation:**

*   The options were granted sometime prior to November 17, 2020.
*   The options vested in equal installments over a five-year period following the award date.
*   By November 17, 2020, the options were fully vested, meaning Hall had the right to exercise all of them. This explains why the expiration date is relatively close to the transaction date in 2025.

### 4. Overall Assessment

Michael James Hall exercised options to buy 225 shares of TRUSTCO BANK CORP N Y stock on August 27, 2025, and immediately disposed of those shares. The exercise price was $0, indicating these were likely granted as part of a compensation package. The footnote clarifies that the options vested over a five-year period and were fully vested by November 17, 2020. The immediate disposal suggests a cashless exercise strategy.

### 5. Signature

*   **/S/ MICHAEL M. OZIMEK, BY POWER OF ATTORNEY**
*   **Date: 2025-08-29**

This indicates that Michael M. Ozimek signed the document on behalf of Michael James Hall, under power of attorney.

### 6. Additional Considerations

*   **Company Performance:** It would be beneficial to correlate these transactions with TRUSTCO BANK CORP N Y's stock performance around the transaction date (August 27, 2025) to understand the potential profit realized by Hall.
*   **Other Filings:** Reviewing other Form 4 filings by Hall and other insiders could provide a broader picture of insider sentiment and trading activity.

**4. Derivative Transactions:**

| Security                  | Transaction Date | Shares | Price | Code | A/D | Exercise Date | Expiration Date | Post Transaction Shares | Ownership |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | ------ | ----- | ---- | --- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- | --------- |
| OPTION TO BUY: RT-TO-BUY | 2025-08-27       | 225    | 0     | M    | D   | None          | 2025-11-17      | 0                         | D         |

*   **Security:** OPTION TO BUY: RT-TO-BUY (Right to Buy)
*   **Transaction Date:** August 27, 2025
*   **Shares:** 225
*   **Price:** \$0 (This indicates the exercise price of the option)
*   **Transaction Code:** M (Exercise or conversion of derivative security)
*   **Acquired/Disposed (A/D):** D (Disposed of)
*   **Exercise Date:** None (Likely already vested, see footnote)
*   **Expiration Date:** November 17, 2025

**5. Footnotes:**

*   **F1:** "Award vested in equal installments from the first thought the fifth year following the award date, and was fully vested on November 17, 2020."

**Analysis and Interpretation:**

*   **Nature of Transaction:** Michael James Hall exercised options to purchase 225 shares of TRUSTCO BANK CORP N Y stock. The options were 'Right to Buy' options, with an exercise price of \$0. The 'M' transaction code confirms this exercise.
*   **Vesting Schedule:** The footnote indicates that the options vested in equal installments over five years and were fully vested by November 17, 2020. This explains why the exercise date is not explicitly provided; the options were exercisable at any point after full vesting but before the expiration date.
*   **Post-Transaction Holdings:** After exercising the options and presumably selling or otherwise disposing of the underlying shares, Hall no longer holds any of these specific derivative securities (post-transaction shares = 0).
*   **Implications:** This Form 4 filing indicates that Hall exercised previously granted stock options. The fact that the exercise price was \$0 suggests these were likely granted as part of a compensation package. The subsequent disposal of the shares acquired through the option exercise is not detailed in this filing but would likely be reported in a separate transaction if the shares were sold on the open market.

**6. Signature:**

*   **/S/ MICHAEL M. OZIMEK, BY POWER OF ATTORNEY**
*   **Date:** 2025-08-29

This indicates that Michael M. Ozimek signed the document on behalf of Michael James Hall, authorized through a Power of Attorney.

### 4. Analysis of Reported Transactions and Holdings

The Form 4 indicates no transactions (purchases, sales, or other acquisitions/dispositions) and no holdings (either derivative or non-derivative) by Jean-Marc Gilson as of the reporting date. This absence of reported activity can be interpreted in several ways:

### 5. Potential Explanations and Further Investigation

Given the lack of reported transactions and holdings, further investigation may be warranted to understand Jean-Marc Gilson's relationship with Westlake Chemical Partners LP.  Potential avenues for further research include:

*   **Relationship with Westlake Chemical Corporation:** Investigating any connections between Jean-Marc Gilson and Westlake Chemical Corporation (the parent company) could reveal indirect relationships or benefits that don't necessitate direct WLKP security ownership.
*   **Review of Previous Filings:** Examining previous Form 3, 4, and 5 filings (if any exist) for Jean-Marc Gilson related to WLKP or its affiliates.
*   **Beneficial Ownership Rules:** Understanding the SEC's beneficial ownership rules to determine if any indirect ownership or control triggers reporting requirements.

### 6. Conclusion

The Form 4 filing by Jean-Marc Gilson indicates no reportable transactions or holdings in Westlake Chemical Partners LP as of August 27, 2025. While this suggests no direct investment activity, further investigation into his broader relationship with Westlake Chemical Corporation and its affiliates is recommended to provide a more complete picture.
