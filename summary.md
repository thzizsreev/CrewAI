### 2. Reporting Owner Profile: Christopher A. Marlett

Christopher A. Marlett holds multiple key positions within MDB Capital Holdings, LLC: Director, Officer, and 10% Owner. This signifies a significant level of influence and responsibility within the company.  His insider status requires him to report any transactions involving the company's securities to the SEC via Form 4 filings. Tracking his filings over time can provide insights into his investment strategy and sentiment regarding the company's prospects.

### 3. Analysis of Reported Holdings and Transactions

The provided data indicates that there were no derivative or non-derivative holdings or transactions reported in this specific filing. The absence of transactions suggests either no changes in holdings during the reporting period or that any changes occurred outside the scope requiring immediate reporting (e.g., gifts, inheritance, or transactions in exempt securities).

*   **Non-Derivative Holdings:** None reported.
*   **Derivative Transactions:** None reported.
*   **Derivative Holdings:** None reported.

This lack of transaction data, while seemingly uneventful, is important to note. It could indicate a period of stability in Marlett's holdings or a strategic decision to refrain from trading. Further investigation of past and subsequent filings would be necessary to draw definitive conclusions.

### 4. Examination of Footnotes

The filing includes two footnotes, which provide crucial context:

*   **F1:** "Held as custodian for minor" - This footnote indicates that some of the reported securities are held by Marlett in a custodial capacity for a minor. This is a common practice and does not necessarily imply direct personal benefit from the securities. The specifics of the custodial arrangement are not detailed in this filing but are important to acknowledge.

*   **F2:** "The reported price in Column 4 is an average purchase price. The shares acquired on August 29, 2025 were purchased in multiple transactions at prices ranging from $3.50 to $3.55 per share. The Reporting Person undertakes to provide to the Issuer, any security holder of the Issuer, or the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, upon request, full information regarding the number of shares purchased at each separate price within the range set forth in this footnote." - This footnote is particularly important. Even though there are no transactions reported directly, this footnote refers to transactions on August 29, 2025. The shares were purchased in multiple transactions at prices ranging from $3.50 to $3.55. This indicates a purchase occurred very close to the reporting period. The fact that the reporting person is willing to provide detailed information upon request suggests transparency and compliance.

### 5. Implications and Further Research

*   **Lack of Transaction Data:** The absence of reported transactions in the core filing necessitates a review of previous and subsequent Form 4 filings by Christopher A. Marlett to establish a trend and understand his trading behavior.

*   **Custodial Holdings:** The presence of custodial holdings should be considered when analyzing Marlett's overall beneficial ownership. These holdings, while under his control, may be subject to specific legal and fiduciary obligations.

*   **Price Range Disclosure:** The detailed price range disclosure in footnote F2 enhances transparency and provides valuable information about the execution of the purchase transactions. This level of detail is commendable and demonstrates a commitment to compliance.

*   **Company Performance Context:** To fully understand the significance of Marlett's holdings and any transactions, it is essential to consider the overall performance of MDB Capital Holdings, LLC during the reporting period and beyond. Analyzing the company's financial statements, news releases, and other public disclosures will provide valuable context.

This Form 4 filing reveals that Shawn Marie Soderberg exercised stock options for 25,000 shares of Bloom Energy stock. This transaction reduced her option holdings while potentially increasing her directly held shares (assuming she didn't immediately sell the shares acquired through the option exercise).

The indirect ownership of a significant number of Class A Common Stock shares (396,731) through a trust indicates a long-term investment in Bloom Energy. The trust structure may be for estate planning or asset management purposes.

**Potential Implications:**

*   **Market Sentiment:** While a single Form 4 transaction is not definitive, the exercise of vested options could be interpreted in several ways. It could signal confidence in the company's future performance (if the shares are held) or a desire to realize gains (if the shares were sold immediately after exercise).
*   **Executive Compensation:** This filing provides insight into the compensation structure for individuals associated with Bloom Energy, even if they are not executive officers or directors. Stock options are a common tool for aligning employee incentives with shareholder value.
*   **Ownership Structure:** The filing reinforces the understanding of Bloom Energy's ownership structure, highlighting the role of trusts and individual investors in holding the company's stock.

### 8. Recommendations for Further Research

*   **Review past Form 4 filings:** Analyze previous filings by Shawn Marie Soderberg to identify trends in her trading activity and option exercises.
*   **Examine other insider transactions:** Compare Soderberg's transactions with those of other Bloom Energy insiders (officers and directors) to gauge overall sentiment.
*   **Analyze Bloom Energy's financial performance:** Assess the company's recent financial results and future outlook to understand the context of insider trading activity.
*   **Investigate the Shawn M. Soderberg 2005 Trust:** If possible, gather more information about the trust's purpose and beneficiaries to understand the underlying ownership dynamics.

### Summary of Filing

This Form 4 filing reports a transaction by Shawn Marie Soderberg involving Bloom Energy Corp's stock options. Specifically, it details the exercise of stock options and subsequent decrease in derivative holdings. Soderberg also holds Class A Common Stock indirectly through a trust.

### Detailed Analysis

**1. Reporting Owner's Role:**

Shawn Marie Soderberg is not an insider (Director, Officer, or 10% Owner) at Bloom Energy Corp. This suggests that Soderberg's transactions are less likely to be driven by material non-public information and more likely related to personal investment decisions or compensation arrangements.

**2. Non-Derivative Securities Holdings:**

| Security              | Shares | Ownership | Ownership Note                                               |
| --------------------- | ------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Class A Common Stock | 396731 | Indirect  | Held by The Shawn M. Soderberg 2005 Trust, of which the Reporting Person is the trustee. |

*   Soderberg indirectly holds a significant number of Bloom Energy's Class A Common Stock through a trust. This indicates a substantial investment in the company. The footnote clarifies that Soderberg acts as the trustee for this trust, granting her control over these shares.

**3. Derivative Securities Transactions:**

| Security                   | Transaction Date | Shares | Price | Code | Acquired/Disposed | Exercise Date | Expiration Date | Post Transaction Shares | Ownership |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | ------ | ----- | ---- | ----------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- | --------- |
| Stock Option (right to buy) | 2025-08-28       | 25000  | 0.00  | M    | D                 | N/A           | 2026-01-13      | 36666                   | D         |

*   **Transaction:** Soderberg exercised 25,000 stock options on August 28, 2025. The exercise price was $0.00, which is typical for stock options granted as compensation. The transaction code "M" signifies the exercise of a derivative security. "D" indicates disposition of the options.
*   **Impact on Holdings:** After the transaction, Soderberg holds 36,666 stock options. This implies that Soderberg previously held 25,000 + 36,666 = 61,666 options before this transaction.
*   **Expiration Date:** The options that were exercised had an expiration date of January 13, 2026. This suggests that Soderberg exercised these options before they expired.
*   **Vesting:** Footnote F2 states that these stock options are fully vested. This means that Soderberg had the right to exercise these options at any time before the expiration date.

**4. Derivative Securities Holdings Post-Transaction:**

The filing indicates no derivative security holdings after the transaction. This is inconsistent with the derivative transaction table, which shows 36,666 options held post transaction. This could be an error in the filing, or a subsequent transaction occurred that was not captured in this specific Form 4.

**5. Footnotes:**

*   **F1:** Clarifies the indirect ownership of Class A Common Stock through "The Shawn M. Soderberg 2005 Trust."
*   **F2:** Confirms that the stock options were fully vested.

**6. Signature:**

The Form 4 was signed by Shawn M. Soderberg on August 29, 2025, confirming the accuracy of the reported information.

---

### Implications and Further Research

*   **Investment Strategy:** The exercise of stock options and continued holding of common stock suggest a positive outlook on Bloom Energy's future performance.
*   **Compensation:** The stock options likely represent a form of compensation from Bloom Energy, even though Soderberg is not listed as an officer or director. Further investigation into Soderberg's relationship with Bloom Energy might be warranted to understand the context of these options.
*   **Inconsistency in Holdings:** The discrepancy between the derivative transaction table and the derivative holdings section needs clarification. Reviewing subsequent filings or contacting investor relations could resolve this issue.

### Recommendations

2.  **Research Soderberg's Relationship:** Explore the nature of Shawn Marie Soderberg's connection to Bloom Energy Corp to better understand the context of the stock option grants.

While the specific transaction details are not explicitly provided in the input data, the footnotes indicate multiple sales at weighted average prices. To fully understand the context, we would ideally have the transaction table from the Form 4, which is missing from the provided data. However, we can analyze the available information.

Based on the footnotes, Rosenthal sold shares in multiple transactions with prices spanning from $71.07 to $73.46. The weighted average prices and price ranges are detailed below:

| Footnote | Price Range        | Weighted Average Price (Reported in Column 4 of Form 4 - *Missing*) | Number of Shares Sold (Reported in Column 4 of Form 4 - *Missing*) |
| :------- | :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |

**Important Note:** The actual weighted average prices and the corresponding number of shares sold for each range are missing from the provided data. These values would typically be found in Columns 4 and 5 of Table I (Derivative Securities Transactions) of the Form 4. Without this information, a complete quantitative analysis is not possible.

**4. Regulatory Undertaking**

The filing includes a standard undertaking by the reporting person (or their attorney-in-fact) to provide full information regarding the number of shares sold at each separate price within the specified ranges, upon request, to MP Materials Corp., any security holder, or the SEC staff. This is a common requirement when using weighted average pricing for reporting sales.

**5. Potential Implications and Further Research**

*   **Reason for Sale:** Without further information, it is impossible to determine the reason for these sales. It could be for personal financial planning, diversification, or other reasons.
*   **Market Impact:** The impact of these sales on the market price of MP Materials Corp. stock would depend on the volume of shares sold and the overall market conditions. Given the weighted average pricing and the undertaking to provide detailed information, it suggests these were likely a series of smaller transactions executed over a period of time.
*   **Company Performance and News:** To gain a better understanding, it would be beneficial to analyze MP Materials Corp.'s financial performance, recent news, and industry trends around the period of this filing (August 2025). This could provide context for the insider's trading activity.
*   **Prior Filings:** Reviewing Rosenthal's previous Form 4 filings for MP Materials Corp. would help establish a pattern of trading activity and provide a historical perspective.
*   **Total Holdings:** While this filing indicates Rosenthal directly owns 126,622 shares through a family trust, it's important to check other filings to determine if Rosenthal has any other direct or indirect holdings.

**6. Missing Information and Recommendations**

The primary limitation of this analysis is the absence of the transaction table from the Form 4 filing. Specifically, the weighted average prices and the number of shares sold at each price range are crucial for a complete understanding.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Obtain the complete Form 4 filing:** Access the full Form 4 filing from the SEC's EDGAR database (using the provided CIK number for MP Materials Corp.) to retrieve the missing transaction details.

**Key Observations:**

*   **Code "M":** Indicates the exercise of a derivative security.
*   **Price "0.00":**  The exercise price of the options is $0.00, meaning the options were "in the money" and exercising them resulted in an immediate gain (before any subsequent sale).
*   **Acquired/Disposed "D":** Shares were disposed of, which in this context means the options were exercised, and the underlying shares were acquired. The shares are then likely sold in the open market (though this isn't explicitly stated in this filing).
*   **Expiration Date:** All options had an expiration date of September 10, 2025. The footnote clarifies that these options were granted approximately 10 years prior and would expire if not exercised before the expiration date within the company's open trading window.
*   **Sequential Exercises:** The options were exercised over five consecutive trading days, suggesting a deliberate strategy to manage the impact on the stock price or to comply with trading window restrictions.
*   **Final Holding:** After these transactions, the reporting owner holds 0 shares directly from derivative holdings.

**3. Footnotes Analysis:**

The footnotes provide crucial context for understanding the transactions.

*   **F1:** "This Form 4 reports the exercise of an employee stock option by the Reporting Person that was granted approximately 10 years ago and that would otherwise expire on September 10, 2025 if not exercised during the Issuer's open trading window for insiders prior to such expiration." - *Confirms the reason for the exercise: avoiding expiration.*
*   **F2 - F9:** These footnotes are not directly related to the current transactions.

**4. Implications and Potential Motivations:**

*   **Profit Taking:** The exercise of "in the money" options suggests a desire to realize profits from the appreciation of Bloom Energy's stock over the past decade.
*   **Expiration Avoidance:** The imminent expiration date of the options was a primary driver for the exercise.
*   **Diversification/Liquidity:** The reporting person may be diversifying their investments or seeking liquidity for other purposes.
*   **Compliance:** The exercises were likely conducted within the company's approved trading window to ensure compliance with insider trading regulations.

**5. Signature:**

The filing was signed by Shawn M. Soderberg, as attorney-in-fact, on 2025-08-29.

**Conclusion:**

This Form 4 filing indicates that Sridhar KR exercised a significant number of stock options in Bloom Energy Corp prior to their expiration. The exercises were likely motivated by a combination of profit-taking, a desire to avoid the options expiring worthless, and a need for liquidity. The reporting owner continues to hold a substantial amount of Bloom Energy stock through trusts, signaling a continued long-term interest in the company. The timing of the transactions suggests careful planning and adherence to insider trading regulations.

| Security                    | Transaction Date | Shares | Price | Code | Acquired/Disposed | Exercise Date | Expiration Date | Post Transaction Shares | Ownership |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- | ------ | ----- | ---- | ----------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- | --------- |
| Stock Option (right to buy) | 2025-08-25       | 60,000 | 0.00  | M    | D                 | None          | 2025-09-10      | 206,667                 | D         |
| Stock Option (right to buy) | 2025-08-26       | 60,000 | 0.00  | M    | D                 | None          | 2025-09-10      | 146,667                 | D         |

**Analysis of Option Exercises:**

*   **Code 'M'**: Indicates the exercise of a derivative security.
*   **Price '0.00'**: Suggests these are employee stock options with a nominal exercise price (or the price is not reported as it is standard).
*   **Expiration Date '2025-09-10'**:  The footnote 'F1' confirms these options were expiring soon, motivating the exercise.
*   **Acquired/Disposed 'D'**: Indicates disposition, meaning the options were exercised and the underlying shares were acquired.
*   **The options are fully vested (Footnote F9)**
*   **The exercise of these options occurs during the Issuer's open trading window for insiders.**

**Implications:**

The exercise of these options suggests that Sridhar KR likely views the current market price of Bloom Energy stock as favorable, as exercising the options allows him to acquire shares at the grant price (likely significantly lower than the market price). The rapid succession of exercises just before the expiration date further reinforces this interpretation.

### 4. Footnotes Analysis

The footnotes provide crucial context to the transactions.

*   **F1**:  Explains the reason for the option exercises: impending expiration. This is a common practice to avoid losing the value of the options.
*   **F2**: "Reflects the transfer of 400,000 shares from the Reporting Person's direct holdings to Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts ("GRATs") for which the Reporting Person is a trustee. The transfer did not change the total number of shares of Class A Common Stock beneficially owned by the Reporting Person." - This indicates estate planning activity where shares are being transferred into GRATs.
*   **F3 - F5, F7, F8**: These footnotes relate to sales of shares with weighted average prices. They indicate that Sridhar KR has been actively selling shares at prices ranging from $48.52 to $54.29. This is important context for understanding the overall strategy.
*   **F6**: "Reflects receipt of annuity payments representing an aggregate of 44,338 shares by the Reporting Person from certain GRATs for which the Reporting Person is a trustee. The annuity payments did not change the total number of shares of Class A Common Stock beneficially owned by the Reporting Person." - This is related to the GRATs mentioned in F2, where Sridhar KR is receiving annuity payments in the form of shares.
*   **F9**: "The stock option is fully vested." - This confirms that the options were exercisable at the time of the transactions.

### 5. Overall Analysis and Potential Interpretations

*   **Option Exercise Strategy:** The imminent expiration of the options is the primary driver for the exercise.
*   **Trust Holdings:** The significant holdings in trusts suggest long-term investment and estate planning strategies.
*   **Sales Activity:** The footnotes indicating sales of shares at varying prices suggest a potential strategy of realizing gains. The exercise of options followed by potential sales of the acquired shares could be a way to convert the value of the options into cash.
*   **GRATs:** The use of GRATs indicates a sophisticated estate planning approach, potentially aimed at minimizing estate taxes.

### 6. Additional Considerations

*   **Bloom Energy's Performance:**  The decision to exercise and potentially sell shares could be influenced by Bloom Energy's recent stock performance and future outlook. A review of the company's financial statements and recent news might provide further insights.
*   **Market Conditions:**  Broader market conditions and investor sentiment towards the energy sector could also play a role in the reporting person's decisions.

### 7. Conclusion

This Form 4 filing reveals a series of stock option exercises by Sridhar KR, driven primarily by the impending expiration of those options. The filing also highlights substantial holdings in trusts and recent sales activity, suggesting a combination of long-term investment, estate planning, and potential profit-taking strategies.

## 2. Issuer and Reporting Owner Information

| Field                  | Value                |
|------------------------|----------------------|

Brannin McBee is not a director, officer, or 10% owner of CoreWeave, Inc. The filing does not specify McBee's relationship to the company.

## 3. Transaction Analysis

The filing indicates that Brannin McBee engaged in derivative transactions. However, based on the provided data, the derivative transactions appear to be absent. This is unusual, especially since footnote F1 refers to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which usually involves sales. Given the absence of transaction data, the amendment likely corrects an error in the original filing.

**Important Note:** Without the actual transaction data, a complete analysis is impossible. The following sections are based on the assumption that the amendment relates to the sale of securities, as suggested by the footnotes.

### 3.1. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan

Footnote F1 states: "The reported transaction represents a sale effected pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by the reporting person on May 20, 2025."

*   **Rule 10b5-1 plans** allow corporate insiders to establish pre-arranged plans for buying or selling company stock at a predetermined time. This can provide a defense against insider trading allegations, as the trades are executed automatically based on the plan's instructions.
*   The adoption date of the plan (May 20, 2025) is prior to the transaction date (August 26, 2025), which is consistent with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1.

### 3.2. Weighted Average Price and Price Range

Footnote F2 states: "The price reported in Column 4 is a weighted average price. These shares were sold in multiple transactions at prices ranging from $90.43 to $91.42, inclusive. The reporting person undertakes to provide to the Issuer, any security holder of the Issuer, or the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, upon request, full information regarding the number of shares sold at each separate price within the ranges set forth in this footnote 2 and in footnotes 3 through 6."

*   The weighted average price indicates that the shares were sold in multiple transactions at slightly different prices within a narrow range ($90.43 - $91.42).
*   The reporting person is committed to providing detailed information about the number of shares sold at each specific price upon request. This level of transparency is commendable.

### 3.3. Indirect Holdings

Footnote F3 states: "The reported securities are directly held by the Brannin J. McBee 2022 Irrevocable Trust, of which the reporting person's spouse and minor child are beneficiaries and for which the reporting person's spouse serves as trustee."

*   The securities are held in an irrevocable trust, suggesting that Brannin McBee may not have direct control over them.
*   The fact that the spouse is the trustee and the spouse and child are beneficiaries indicates a family trust structure. This is a common estate planning strategy.

## 4. Holdings Information

The filing indicates that there are no non-derivative or derivative holdings to report.

## 5. Signature

The filing was signed by /s/ Kristen McVeety, as Attorney-in-Fact, on August 29, 2025. This indicates that McVeety has been authorized to act on behalf of Brannin McBee.

## 6. Potential Implications and Further Research

*   **Reason for Amendment:** The primary question is why this filing is an amendment. Was there an error in the original filing regarding the number of shares sold, the price, or some other detail? Reviewing the original Form 4 is crucial.
*   **Relationship to CoreWeave:** Understanding Brannin McBee's relationship to CoreWeave is important. While not an officer, director, or 10% owner, McBee may be an employee, consultant, or have some other connection to the company.
*   **Trading Volume:** Comparing the number of shares sold by McBee to the overall trading volume of CRWV stock can provide context. A large sale relative to the average daily volume could have a short-term impact on the stock price.
*   **Past Filings:** Examining McBee's past filings (if any) related to CoreWeave can reveal a pattern of trading activity and provide further insights.

## 7. Summary

This Form 4/A filing indicates that Brannin McBee sold shares of CoreWeave, Inc. through a pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. The shares were held in an irrevocable trust. The amendment suggests a correction to a previous filing. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact nature of the correction and the broader context of McBee's transactions. The absence of actual transaction data is a significant limitation to this analysis.

# SEC Filings Summary

**Overall Summary:**

This report analyzes an SEC Form 4/A filing by Brannin McBee related to CoreWeave, Inc. The filing is an amendment, but critically lacks transaction data, limiting the depth of analysis. McBee is not a director, officer, or 10% owner, but is associated with CoreWeave through the Brannin J. McBee 2022 Irrevocable Trust. Footnotes suggest that any sales were executed under a pre-existing 10b5-1 trading plan. The absence of transaction details makes it impossible to determine the number of shares sold, the impact on McBee's holdings, or the total value of the transaction. Obtaining the complete Form 4/A document with transaction details is crucial for a comprehensive understanding.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Missing Transaction Data:** The absence of transaction details (purchases/sales) in the provided data is a critical limitation, preventing a full assessment of the filing's impact.
*   **10b5-1 Trading Plan:** Footnote F1 indicates that any sales were conducted under a pre-existing Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, suggesting pre-planned transactions to avoid insider trading concerns.
*   **Irrevocable Trust:** Footnote F3 reveals that the reported securities are held in an irrevocable trust for the benefit of McBee's spouse and child, adding complexity to the ownership structure.
*   **Limited Insider Status:** Brannin McBee is not a director, officer, or 10% owner, but his association with CoreWeave through the trust necessitates the filing.
*   **Need for Further Investigation:** A complete understanding requires obtaining the full Form 4/A document and further researching the relationship between Brannin McBee and CoreWeave, Inc.

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Subject:** Analysis of Form 4/A Filing by Brannin McBee regarding CoreWeave, Inc. (CRWV)

### 1. Filing Overview

*   **Form Type:** 4/A (Amendment to Form 4)
*   **Period of Report:** 2025-08-26
*   **Issuer:** CoreWeave, Inc. (CRWV), CIK: 0001769628
*   **Reporting Owner:** Brannin McBee, CIK: 0002058103

*   **Signature:** /s/ Kristen McVeety, as Attorney-in-Fact
*   **Date of Signature:** 2025-08-29

### 2. Reporting Owner Details

Brannin McBee is not a director, officer, or 10% owner of CoreWeave, Inc. The filing indicates no specific "other" relationship to the company. This suggests Mr. McBee may be an investor or have some other indirect association with CoreWeave.  Further investigation into past filings or company disclosures might reveal more about the nature of this relationship.

### 3. Transaction Analysis

This Form 4/A filing does not contain details of derivative or non-derivative transactions. The original prompt only included information regarding holdings and footnotes. Therefore, I can only provide an analysis based on the available data.

**Important Note:**  The absence of transaction details in the provided data significantly limits the depth of analysis. A complete Form 4/A filing would typically include a table of non-derivative and/or derivative transactions.

### 4. Holdings Summary

*   **Non-Derivative Holdings:** No non-derivative holdings reported.
*   **Derivative Transactions:** No derivative transactions reported.
*   **Derivative Holdings:** No derivative holdings reported.

**Note:** The lack of holdings information makes it impossible to determine the impact of any transactions on the reporting person's overall position in CoreWeave.

### 5. Footnote Analysis

The footnotes provide crucial context for understanding the transactions (or lack thereof, given the missing transaction data).

*   **F1:** "The reported transaction represents a sale effected pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by the reporting person on May 20, 2025."

    *   **Implication:** This indicates that any sale reported (if the transaction data were available) was pre-planned. Rule 10b5-1 allows insiders to establish a predetermined trading schedule to avoid accusations of trading on material non-public information. This suggests that Brannin McBee had a trading plan in place since May 20, 2025.

*   **F2:** "The price reported in Column 4 is a weighted average price. These shares were sold in multiple transactions at prices ranging from $90.43 to $91.42, inclusive. The reporting person undertakes to provide to the Issuer, any security holder of the Issuer, or the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, upon request, full information regarding the number of shares sold at each separate price within the ranges set forth in this footnote 2 and in footnotes 3 through 6."

    *   **Implication:** This footnote confirms that if there were sales, they occurred at varying prices within a narrow range. The weighted average price would provide a single value for reporting purposes, but the footnote ensures transparency by offering to disclose the specific details of each sale upon request. This suggests a need for precise record-keeping and a commitment to regulatory compliance.

*   **F3:** "The reported securities are directly held by the Brannin J. McBee 2022 Irrevocable Trust, of which the reporting person's spouse and minor child are beneficiaries and for which the reporting person's spouse serves as trustee."

    *   **Implication:** This clarifies that the securities are held in an irrevocable trust. Even though Brannin McBee is the reporting person, the trust structure means that the assets are managed for the benefit of his spouse and child, with his spouse acting as trustee. This adds a layer of complexity to the ownership structure.  Sales from the trust would still be reported under McBee's name due to his association with the trust.

### 6. Missing Transaction Data & Potential Impact

The absence of transaction data (specifically, the table detailing purchases and sales) is a significant limitation. Without this information, it's impossible to assess:

*   The number of shares sold (if any).
*   The impact of the sale on McBee's overall holdings.
*   The total value of the transaction.
*   The nature of the transaction (purchase, sale, gift, etc.).

If the transaction data were available, the following table would be included:

**Hypothetical Transaction Table (Example - Data NOT Available in Provided Input)**

| Transaction Date | Transaction Type | Securities Acquired (A) / Disposed of (D) | Transaction Price ($) | Shares Owned Following Transaction |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 2025-08-26       | Sale              | 1,000 (D)                                 | $90.92 (Weighted Avg.)  | [Unknown - Requires Actual Data]   |

### 7. Conclusion

Based on the available information, this Form 4/A filing indicates that Brannin McBee, while not an insider in the traditional sense, is associated with CoreWeave, Inc. through an irrevocable trust.  The footnotes suggest that any sales were conducted under a pre-existing 10b5-1 trading plan and occurred within a defined price range.

**Recommendation:**  To gain a complete understanding of this filing, it is essential to obtain the full Form 4/A document, including the transaction details. This will allow for a comprehensive assessment of the impact on Brannin McBee's holdings and the overall context of the transaction. Further research into the relationship between Brannin McBee and CoreWeave, Inc. would also be beneficial.

*   **Indirect Control:** While the majority of holdings are indirect, McBee Brannin retains significant control over many of the entities holding the securities, either as trustee or manager.
*   **Conversion Activity:** The conversion of Class B Common Stock to Class A Common Stock could be related to various factors, including potential sales of stock or adjustments to ownership structure. Further investigation into subsequent Form 4 filings may reveal the ultimate disposition of the converted shares.

*   On the same day, McBee also converted and disposed of 375,000 shares of Class B Common Stock held indirectly, decreasing his indirect holdings to 5,541,020 shares.

**5. Derivative Securities Holdings:**

| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| Class B Common Stock  | None           | None          | None            | 2,300,300         | I         |

**Analysis of Derivative Holdings:**

*   McBee indirectly holds a significant number of Class B Common Stock shares.  The absence of exercise prices and dates suggests these are likely related to conversion rights rather than options.
*   The various holdings likely correspond to different trusts or entities as described in the footnotes.

**6. Footnotes Analysis:**

*   **F1:** Class B Common Stock is convertible to Class A Common Stock. This is a crucial detail, as it indicates the potential for changes in the company's share structure and McBee's holdings.
*   **F2 - F10:** These footnotes detail the indirect ownership structure, primarily involving trusts and LLCs benefiting McBee's spouse and child.  This highlights the importance of considering the broader family financial picture when analyzing McBee's holdings.  Specifically, we see the use of:
    *   Irrevocable Trusts (2022 Irrevocable Trust, Canis Major SM Trust, 2024 Irrevocable Trust LLC)
    *   Family Trusts (Canis Major 2025 Family Trust LLC, Canis Minor 2025 Family Trust LLC)
    *   Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs) (Canis Major 2025 GRAT, Canis Minor 2025 GRAT)
    *   Direct holdings by a minor child.
    *   Direct holdings by spouse.

**7. Signature:**

*   Signed by Kristen McVeety, as Attorney-in-Fact on 2025-08-29.

**8. Overall Analysis and Potential Implications:**

*   **Conversion Activity:** The conversion of Class B to Class A shares suggests a strategic decision by McBee, possibly related to liquidity, voting rights, or other factors. Further investigation into the specific reasons for the conversion would be beneficial.
*   **Indirect Ownership Structure:** The complex web of trusts and LLCs indicates sophisticated estate planning.  It's important to understand the terms of these trusts to fully grasp McBee's control and economic interest in the shares.
*   **Family Beneficiaries:** The involvement of McBee's spouse and child as beneficiaries highlights the importance of considering the broader family financial context.
*   **Potential for Future Transactions:** Given the significant holdings and the conversion feature, future Form 4 filings should be monitored closely for further transactions.
*   **Company Strategy:** The filing provides insight into insider activity, which can be a valuable signal, but should be considered alongside other financial data and company news to form a comprehensive investment thesis.

**9. Recommendations:**

*   Review past Form 4 filings by McBee to identify trends in his trading activity and ownership structure.
*   Analyze CoreWeave, Inc.'s financial statements and other SEC filings (e.g., 10-K, 10-Q) to gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance and prospects.
*   Monitor news and press releases related to CoreWeave, Inc. to identify any potential catalysts for changes in the stock price.
*   Consult with a financial advisor to discuss the implications of this Form 4 filing for your investment decisions.

**Date of Report:** August 29, 2025
**Form Type:** 4

This document provides a detailed analysis of the Form 4 filing submitted by Brian M. Venturo, concerning his holdings and transactions in CoreWeave, Inc. (CRWV) stock.  Mr. Venturo is not a director, officer, or 10% owner of the company.

### I. Non-Derivative Securities Holdings

The following table summarizes Mr. Venturo's holdings in CoreWeave, Inc. Class A Common Stock:

| Security               | Shares | Ownership | Ownership Note            |
| ---------------------- | ------ | --------- | -------------------------- |
| Class A Common Stock | 240,331 | D         | Direct                    |
| Class A Common Stock | 264,469 | I         | YOLO APV Trust            |
| Class A Common Stock | 264,469 | I         | YOLO ECV Trust            |
| Class A Common Stock | 22,500  | I         | See Footnote (Father-in-law) |

**Analysis of Non-Derivative Holdings:**

*   **Direct Ownership:** Mr. Venturo directly owns 240,331 shares of Class A Common Stock.
*   **Indirect Ownership - YOLO APV Trust:** He indirectly owns 264,469 shares through the YOLO APV Trust. Footnote F3 clarifies that this is an irrevocable trust for his minor child, with a third-party trustee. Mr. Venturo can remove and replace the trustee. This suggests a degree of control, hence the indirect ownership attribution.
*   **Indirect Ownership - YOLO ECV Trust:**  Similar to the YOLO APV Trust, Mr. Venturo indirectly owns 264,469 shares through the YOLO ECV Trust (Footnote F4), also for his minor child, with the power to replace the trustee.
*   **Indirect Ownership - Father-in-law:**  He indirectly owns 22,500 shares held by his father-in-law (Footnote F5). Mr. Venturo disclaims beneficial ownership except to the extent of any pecuniary interest. This disclaimer is important because it suggests he doesn't necessarily benefit directly from these shares.

### II. Derivative Securities Transactions

The following table details Mr. Venturo's derivative securities transactions:

| Security            | Transaction Date | Shares | Price | Code | Acquired/Disposed | Post-Transaction Shares | Ownership |

| Class B Common Stock | 2025-08-29       | 281,250 | N/A   | C    | D                 | 6,274,500               | I         |

**Transaction Code Explanation:**

*   **C:** Conversion of derivative security.
*   **D:** Disposal.

**Analysis of Derivative Transactions:**

*   On August 29, 2025, Mr. Venturo converted 281,250 shares of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock (indicated by code 'C' and 'D'). The conversion price is not applicable, as it's a conversion, not a purchase or sale.  This conversion reduced his Class B holdings and presumably increased his (or related entities') Class A holdings, although the corresponding acquisition of Class A shares is not explicitly shown in this transaction table.
*   Post-transaction, Mr. Venturo indirectly held 6,274,500 shares of Class B Common Stock.

### III. Derivative Securities Holdings

The following table summarizes Mr. Venturo's holdings in CoreWeave, Inc. Class B Common Stock:

| Security            | Exercise Price | Exercise Date | Expiration Date | Underlying Shares | Ownership |

| Class B Common Stock | N/A            | N/A           | N/A             | 2,000,000         | I         |
| Class B Common Stock | N/A            | N/A           | N/A             | 4,271,000         | I         |
| Class B Common Stock | N/A            | N/A           | N/A             | 5,500,000         | I         |

**Analysis of Derivative Holdings:**

*   **Direct Ownership:** Mr. Venturo directly owns derivatives representing 14,284,000 underlying shares of Class B Common Stock.

    *   4,271,000 underlying shares of Class B Common Stock.
    *   5,500,000 underlying shares of Class B Common Stock.

**Important Note on Class B Common Stock (Footnote F1):**

Each share of Class B Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class A Common Stock at any time, at the election of the holder.  Conversion also occurs automatically upon certain transfers or events described in CoreWeave's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.  This convertibility is a crucial aspect of understanding the value and potential impact of these holdings.

### IV. Summary and Key Observations

*   Brian Venturo holds a significant number of CoreWeave shares, both directly and indirectly through various trusts and relationships.
*   The conversion of Class B to Class A shares suggests a potential strategy to increase liquidity or voting power (depending on the rights associated with each class). Further investigation into the specific rights of each class of stock as described in the company's charter is recommended.
*   The use of trusts for his minor children indicates estate planning considerations.
*   The disclaimer of beneficial ownership regarding shares held by his father-in-law highlights the importance of carefully distinguishing between legal ownership and actual control or benefit.
*   The large number of Class B common stock holdings, and their convertibility into Class A common stock, represents a significant potential shift in the company's equity structure if these shares are converted.

### V. Further Research Recommendations

*   **Review CoreWeave's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation:** This document will provide critical details about the rights and restrictions associated with both Class A and Class B Common Stock, including voting rights, dividend rights, and conversion triggers.
*   **Investigate the YOLO APV and ECV Trusts:**  Understanding the terms of these trusts, beyond the information provided in the footnotes, will provide a clearer picture of Mr. Venturo's level of control and the beneficiaries' rights.
*   **Monitor Future Filings:** Tracking subsequent Form 4 filings by Mr. Venturo will reveal any further transactions or changes in his holdings.
*   **Analyze overall insider transaction trends:** Comparing Mr. Venturo's transactions with those of other CoreWeave insiders could reveal broader strategic trends within the company.

**Important Note:**  The "Shares Sold" column is marked as "Unknown" because the provided data excerpt does not include the actual number of shares sold within each price range.  The full Form 4 filing would be needed to complete this information.

**4. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan:**

The filing indicates (Footnote F1) that the sale was executed pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted on May 23, 2025.

*   **Significance:** Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate insiders to establish pre-arranged trading plans to sell company stock at predetermined times and prices. This can shield insiders from accusations of trading on material non-public information, as the trading plan is established when the insider does not possess such information.
*   **Implications:** The existence of a 10b5-1 plan suggests that Intrator's sales were planned well in advance and were not based on any recent, specific knowledge about CoreWeave's performance.

**5. Omnadora Capital LLC (Footnote F7):**

*   The filing mentions that the reported securities are directly held by Omnadora Capital LLC ("Omnadora").
*   Intrator is the sole manager of Omnadora's manager, Omnadora Management LLC.
*   Intrator may be deemed to beneficially own securities held by Omnadora but disclaims beneficial ownership except to the extent of his pecuniary interest.

**6. Analysis and Implications:**

*   **Routine Sale:** The use of a 10b5-1 trading plan suggests that these sales are part of a pre-determined strategy and may not necessarily reflect a negative outlook on CoreWeave's future prospects.
*   **Price Range:** The weighted average prices indicate the range in which the shares were sold, providing insight into the market's valuation of CoreWeave stock at the time of the transaction.
*   **Limited Impact:** Given that Intrator is not a director, officer, or ten-percent owner, these sales are less likely to have a significant impact on investor sentiment compared to sales by key executives or major shareholders.
*   **Omnadora Capital LLC:** The involvement of Omnadora Capital LLC indicates that Intrator's investment activities are conducted through this entity, which may have its own investment strategy and diversification goals.

**7. Missing Information and Further Research:**

To provide a more comprehensive analysis, the following information would be required:

*   **Exact Number of Shares Sold:** The number of shares sold within each price range is crucial for calculating the total value of the transaction and assessing its potential impact.
*   **Total Holdings:** Information on Intrator's total holdings in CoreWeave, both directly and indirectly (through Omnadora Capital LLC), would provide context for the size of the sale.
*   **Past Transactions:** Reviewing Intrator's past Form 4 filings would help determine if these sales are part of a consistent pattern or a one-time event.
*   **Company Performance:** Analyzing CoreWeave's financial performance and recent news releases would provide a better understanding of the factors that may have influenced the stock price and Intrator's decision to sell.

**8. Conclusion:**

The Form 4 filing indicates a planned sale of CoreWeave shares by Michael N. Intrator under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. While the available data provides some insights into the transaction, additional information is needed to fully assess its implications. The sale appears to be part of a pre-determined strategy and may not necessarily reflect a negative outlook on CoreWeave's future. Further investigation into Intrator's holdings, past transactions, and CoreWeave's financial performance would provide a more complete picture.

*   **Price Range:** The sales occurred at varying prices throughout the day, as indicated by the ranges provided in the footnotes. This suggests a series of transactions rather than a single large block trade.
*   **Weighted-Average Price:** The footnotes mention that the weighted-average price is reported. However, the actual weighted-average price is not provided in the initial data. The reporting person commits to providing full details of the trades upon request.
*   **Shares Held by Partnership:** The shares sold are held by Farquhar Investment Partnership No. 2, indicating that the sales are likely part of a broader investment strategy.

### 5. Implications and Considerations

*   **Market Impact:**  Sales by insiders, even under a 10b5-1 plan, can sometimes be perceived negatively by the market. However, the pre-planned nature of these sales should reassure investors that they are not based on current, non-public information.
*   **Transparency:** The reporting owner's commitment to providing detailed transaction information upon request to the SEC, the issuer, or a security holder enhances transparency.
*   **Future Filings:** Monitoring future Form 4 filings by Scott Farquhar and other Atlassian insiders will provide a more complete picture of insider trading activity and potential trends.

### 6. Missing Information

The primary limitation of this analysis is the absence of specific transaction details, such as the number of shares sold in each transaction and the weighted-average price for each. Access to the complete Form 4 filing is necessary for a more precise analysis.
