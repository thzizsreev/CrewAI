**4. Detailed Analysis of Reported Data**

Given the limited information provided, a complete analysis is challenging.  However, we can highlight key aspects and potential areas for further investigation:

*   **Absence of Transaction Data:** The lack of reported transactions (derivative or non-derivative) is notable. It could indicate:
    *   No transactions occurred during the reporting period.
    *   The provided data is a partial extract of a larger filing.
    *   The transactions were reported under a different form or section.

*   **Reporting Owner's Status:** Marlett's position as a Director, Officer, and 10% owner is significant.  This implies a high degree of insider knowledge and influence.  Any transactions by Marlett would be closely scrutinized for potential insider trading or conflicts of interest.

*   **Footnotes:** The footnotes provided relate to a different transaction date (August 29, 2025) and provide information about share purchases. This suggests that the complete Form 4 filing likely includes purchase information. The footnote specifies:

    *   **Date:** 2025-08-29

**3. Detailed Analysis**

**3.1. Issuer (Garmin Ltd.)**

Garmin Ltd. (GRMN) is a well-known global provider of navigation, communications, and information devices and applications. The company operates in various segments, including automotive, aviation, fitness, marine, and outdoor recreation. Its stock is publicly traded, and insider transactions are closely monitored by investors and regulators.

**3.2. Reporting Owner (Kao Min H.)**

Kao Min H. is identified in the filing as neither a director, officer, nor a 10% owner of Garmin Ltd. The "Is Other" field is also false, suggesting that Kao Min H. does not hold any other specific relationship with the company that would necessitate reporting under SEC rules, other than potentially being a significant shareholder below the 10% threshold. The filing indicates a gift of shares to a charitable organization.

**3.3. Transaction Analysis**

The core of this Form 4 filing revolves around the gifting of shares to a charitable organization. While the filing doesn't specify the number of shares gifted, the presence of footnote "F1" clearly indicates this type of transaction.

*   **Significance of the Gift:** Charitable donations of stock are a common practice among high-net-worth individuals. These donations can provide tax benefits to the donor, while also benefiting the charitable organization. From an investment perspective, such a donation doesn't necessarily reflect a negative outlook on the company's future. It is more likely related to personal philanthropic goals and tax planning strategies.

*   **Lack of Specific Details:** The absence of details regarding the number of shares, the date of the gift, and the name of the charitable organization is notable. While Form 4 requires reporting of transactions, the details can sometimes be found in other filings or public statements if deemed material.

**3.4. Signature and Attorney-in-Fact**

The filing was signed by Paul E. Cassat as attorney-in-fact for Min H. Kao. This indicates that Kao Min H. has authorized Cassat to act on their behalf in matters related to SEC filings. The use of an attorney-in-fact is a common practice, especially for individuals with busy schedules or those who prefer to delegate administrative tasks.

**4. Implications and Context**

*   **Market Sentiment:** Given that the transaction involves a charitable gift, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on market sentiment. Investors typically focus on open market purchases and sales by insiders as indicators of their confidence in the company's prospects.

*   **Compliance:** The filing appears to be compliant with SEC regulations, as it discloses the necessary information regarding the transaction and the reporting owner's relationship with the company.

*   **Further Research:** To gain a more complete understanding, it would be beneficial to:
    *   Review Kao Min H.'s past filings to identify any patterns in their transactions.
    *   Monitor future filings for any additional transactions or changes in their holdings.
    *   Search for any public statements or press releases related to the charitable donation.

# SEC Filings Summary

**Overall Summary:**

This report analyzes a Form 4 filing by Scott Farquhar, concerning transactions in Atlassian Corp (TEAM) shares. The key finding is that Farquhar executed multiple sales of Atlassian shares on August 28, 2025, under a pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted on February 12, 2025. The transactions were executed at weighted-average prices, with the shares held through Farquhar Investment Partnership No. 2. The existence of the 10b5-1 plan suggests that the sales were pre-planned and not based on any recent non-public information. However, a comprehensive assessment requires further analysis of Farquhar's past trading activity, the timing of the plan's adoption relative to any potential material events at Atlassian, and overall insider trading trends at Atlassian. The weighted-average pricing indicates the transactions occurred over time, likely through a broker.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan:** Sales were executed under a pre-arranged trading plan, suggesting they were not based on recent non-public information. Further investigation into the plan's timing is necessary.
*   **Weighted-Average Pricing:** Transactions occurred over a period at varying prices, indicating execution through a broker.
*   **Investment Partnership:** Shares are held through an investment partnership, potentially impacting tax and estate planning.
*   **Need for Further Analysis:** A complete assessment requires analyzing past trading activity and the timing of the plan's adoption relative to potential material events at Atlassian.

### 1. Overview

This report analyzes a Form 4 filing by Scott Farquhar, a reporting owner of Atlassian Corp (TEAM). The filing pertains to transactions in Atlassian shares and provides insights into his trading activity. The analysis will cover the details of the transactions, relevant footnotes, and potential implications.

### 2. Reporting Owner Details

**Explanation of Hypothetical Transactions:**

*   The table above represents a hypothetical set of sales transactions by Scott Farquhar on 2025-08-28.
*   Each row represents a different sale, with varying numbers of shares sold at different weighted-average prices.
*   The footnotes associated with each transaction (F1, F2, F4, F5, F6, F7) provide important context.

### 4. Footnote Analysis

The footnotes provide critical details about the nature of the transactions.

*   **F1:** "This transaction was effected pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by the Reporting Person on February 12, 2025."

    *   This footnote indicates that the sales were executed according to a pre-arranged trading plan under Rule 10b5-1. Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate insiders to sell shares without being accused of trading on non-public information, provided the trading plan was established before the insider possessed such information. This suggests that the sales were planned well in advance.

*   **F2:** "This transaction was executed in multiple trades during the day at prices ranging from $175.42 to $176.38. The weighted-average price is reported above. The Reporting Person hereby undertakes to provide upon request to the SEC staff, the issuer or a security holder of the issuer full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected."

    *   This footnote explains that the reported price is a weighted average due to multiple trades occurring at slightly different prices throughout the day. It also confirms the reporting person's willingness to provide detailed trade-by-trade information upon request.

*   **F3:** "Shares are held by Farquhar Investment Partnership No. 2."

    *   This footnote indicates that the shares are held through an investment partnership. This is relevant for understanding the ownership structure and potential tax implications of the transactions.

*   **F4:** "This transaction was executed in multiple trades during the day at prices ranging from $173.17 to $173.92. The weighted-average price is reported above. The Reporting Person hereby undertakes to provide upon request to the SEC staff, the issuer or a security holder of the issuer full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected."

    *   Similar to F2, this explains the weighted-average price for another transaction.

*   **F5:** "This transaction was executed in multiple trades during the day at prices ranging from $174.42 to $175.42. The weighted-average price is reported above. The Reporting Person hereby undertakes to provide upon request to the SEC staff, the issuer or a security holder of the issuer full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected."

    *   Similar to F2 and F4, this explains the weighted-average price for another transaction.

*   **F6:** "This transaction was executed in multiple trades during the day at prices ranging from $177.47 to $177.80. The weighted-average price is reported above. The Reporting Person hereby undertakes to provide upon request to the SEC staff, the issuer or a security holder of the issuer full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected."

    *   Similar to F2, F4 and F5, this explains the weighted-average price for another transaction.

*   **F7:** "This transaction was executed in multiple trades during the day at prices ranging from $176.47 to $177.45. The weighted-average price is reported above. The Reporting Person hereby undertakes to provide upon request to the SEC staff, the issuer or a security holder of the issuer full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transactions were effected."

    *   Similar to F2, F4, F5 and F6, this explains the weighted-average price for another transaction.

### 5. Implications and Considerations

*   **Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan:** The existence of a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan is a significant factor. It suggests that these sales were pre-planned and not based on any recent non-public information. However, it's important to consider the timing of the plan's adoption (February 12, 2025) relative to any potential material events at Atlassian.
*   **Weighted-Average Pricing:** The use of weighted-average pricing indicates that the transactions were executed over a period of time, likely through a broker.
*   **Investment Partnership:** The fact that the shares are held by an investment partnership may have tax and estate planning implications for Scott Farquhar.
*   **Overall Trend:** To gain a comprehensive understanding, this filing should be analyzed in conjunction with Farquhar's past trading activity and overall insider trading trends at Atlassian. Observing a pattern of consistent selling under a 10b5-1 plan would be less concerning than sporadic, large sales.

### 6. Conclusion

This Form 4 filing reveals that Scott Farquhar executed sales of Atlassian shares under a pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. The footnotes provide valuable context, indicating that the transactions occurred at weighted-average prices and that the shares are held through an investment partnership. While the existence of a 10b5-1 plan mitigates concerns about insider trading, further analysis of past trading activity and the timing of the plan's adoption is warranted for a complete assessment.
